## 3. Task: Timer
We provide you with a boilerplate for Timer, please build a Timer based on it.
The boilerplate for Timer contains some snippets to save your time. 
### 3.1 Requirements
Build a simple timer app that supports basic operations such as starting and pausing the timer. 
Refer to the UI screenshots below. Additionally, use ReactGenie to integrate voice commands to 
allow multimodality for users. 

Users may use a variety of possible interactions, consider the interactions that the user may 
make to build the entire application, we have given five possible user interaction inputs.

This is the UI of a Timer. 
<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/TimerMain.png" width="45%"/>

<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/TimerForm.png" width="45%"/>

User might use these multimodal interactions:


* User says "Create a new timer for 2 minutes." (with pic 1)
* User says "Delete this time", then click on the timer list.(with pic 1)
* User says "Show me all the default timer."(with pic 1)
* User says "Start all timers."(with pic 1)

* User says "Set the time to one and a half hours."(with pic 2)

### 3.2 Preset Class
ReactGenie has two preset class <font color='red'>**DateTime**</font> and <font color='red'>**TimeDelta**</font>, they are both **HelperClass** objects. 
You can use these to help you build the Timer or you can build your own time management. You can check the **Preset Class** section to get more information about them.

Here we list some function you might need.
```typescript filename="TimeDelta"
//property
    public hour: number;    // an integer representing hours
    public minute: number;  // an integer representing minutes
    public second: number;  // an integer representing seconds
//functions

// Returns a new instance of TimeDelta.
// Arguments are optional, defaults are 0 if not provided. 
// Use to create a new instance of TimeDelta
static CreateTimeDelta({hour?: number, minute?: number, second?: number}) : TimeDelta;
//example: TimeDelta.CreateTimeDelta({hour:0, minute:0, second:0})

// Adds an offset to a TimeDelta instance.
// All arguments are optional and are added to the properties of the instance
addOffset({hour?: number, minute?: number, second?: number});
//example: td.addOffset({hour:1, minute:0, second:0})

// Sets time to a TimeDelta instance.
// All arguments are optional and are seted to the properties of the instance
setTime({hour?: number, minute?: number, second?: number});
//example: td.setTime({hour:1, minute:0, second:0})

// Returns the total amount of time left in seconds.
getLeftSecond():number;
//example: td.getLeftSecond()

//Get the cotent of TimeDelta
toString():string;
//example: td.toString()
```
```typescript filename="DateTime"
static today() : DateTime // Returns today's date as a DateTime object
//example: DateTime.today()

//Get the cotent of DateTime
toString():string;
//example: dt.toString()
```
