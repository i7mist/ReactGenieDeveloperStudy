## 3. Task: Timer
We provide you with a boilerplate for Timer, please build a Timer based on it.
The boilerplate for Timer contains some snippets to save your time. We have also added TODO comments 
in the boilerplate to help guide you to the missing functionalities that are needed.

### 3.1 Task Description
Integrate ReactGenie with a simple timer app as provided in the boilerplate repo to integrate voice commands to 
allow multimodality for users. 

Users may use a variety of possible voice interactions. Think about the different interactions that a user 
might use when interacting with the app. We have given five possible user interaction inputs as an example.

This is the UI of a Timer. 
<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/TimerMain.png" width="45%"/>

<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/TimerForm.png" width="45%"/>

User might use these multimodal interactions:


* User says "Create a new timer for 2 minutes." (with pic 1)
* User says "Delete this time", then click on the timer list.(with pic 1)
* User says "Show me all the default timer."(with pic 1)
* User says "Start all timers."(with pic 1)
* User says "Set the time to one and a half hours."(with pic 2)

### 3.2 Setup
Download the TimerAppBoilerplate

```jscopy
git clone git@github.com:StanfordHCI/TimerAppBoilerplate.git
```

Install dependencies using `npm install`.
You can run the app using `npx expo start --web`.

### 3.3 Preset Class
ReactGenie has two preset class <font color='red'>**DateTime**</font> and <font color='red'>**TimeDelta**</font>, 
they are both **HelperClass** objects. You can either use these to help you build the Timer or build 
your own time management system. Check out the **Preset Class** section to get more information about them.

Here we list some function you might need.
```typescript filename="TimeDelta"
//property
    public hour: number;    // an integer representing hours
    public minute: number;  // an integer representing minutes
    public second: number;  // an integer representing seconds
//functions

// Returns a new instance of TimeDelta.
// Arguments are optional, defaults are 0 if not provided. 
// Use to create a new instance of TimeDelta
static CreateTimeDelta({hour?: number, minute?: number, second?: number}) : TimeDelta;
//example: TimeDelta.CreateTimeDelta({hour:0, minute:0, second:0})

// Adds an offset to a TimeDelta instance.
// All arguments are optional and are added to the properties of the instance
addOffset({hour?: number, minute?: number, second?: number});
//example: td.addOffset({hour:1, minute:0, second:0})

// Sets time to a TimeDelta instance.
// All arguments are optional and are seted to the properties of the instance
setTime({hour?: number, minute?: number, second?: number});
//example: td.setTime({hour:1, minute:0, second:0})

// Returns the total amount of time left in seconds.
getLeftSecond():number;
//example: td.getLeftSecond()

//Get the cotent of TimeDelta
toString():string;
//example: td.toString()
```
```typescript filename="DateTime"
static today() : DateTime // Returns today's date as a DateTime object
//example: DateTime.today()

//Get the cotent of DateTime
toString():string;
//example: dt.toString()
```

### 3.4 Overview of TimerAppBoilerplate 

We've broken the boilerplate code into 3 parts.

1. **State Code**: This is used to control and manage the app, such as managing data and executing functions. 
It is written in the <font color="red">`genie`</font> folder. We've set up a file `genie/Timer.ts` for you. Please implement 
your Timer app state code there.

2. **UI Code**: This is used to display information and interact with the user. It is written in the 
<font color="red">`src`</font> folder. We've already provided all of the UI code for you, but you will need to integrate 
the store data values and methods into the components.

3. **Combine**: This involves linking the State and UI code in <font color="red">`App.tsx`</font> and <font color="red">`store.ts`</font>.

### 3.5 Good luck!

Use the provided comments in the TimerAppBoilerplate, the tutorial with Counter example, and ReactGenie docs to 
complete the timer app with React Genie.
