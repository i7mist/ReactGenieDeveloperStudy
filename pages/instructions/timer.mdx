## 3. Task: Timer

### 2.1 Requirements
Build a simple timer app that supports basic operations such as starting and pausing the timer. 
Refer to the UI screenshots below. Additionally, use ReactGenie to integrate voice commands to 
allow multimodality for users. 

Users may use a variety of possible interactions, consider the interactions that the user may 
make to build the entire application, we have given five possible user interaction inputs.

This is the UI of a Timer.
<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/TimerMain.png" width="45%"/>

<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/TimerForm.png" width="45%"/>

User might use these multimodal interactions:


* User says "Create a new timer for 2 minutes." (with pic 1)
* User says "Delete this time", then click on the timer list.(with pic 1)
* User says "Show me all the default timer."(with pic 1)
* User says "Start all timers."(with pic 1)

* User says "Set the time to one and a half hours."(with pic 2)
