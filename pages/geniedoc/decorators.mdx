# ReactGenie Decorators

> When using **ReactGenie**, developers can use various decorators to declare classes, variables or functions; **ReactGenie** will **automatically process and serialize** related variables according to the developer's description, and **automatically generate functions and LLM prompts** for supporting multimodal input processing according to the description information provided by the developer.

## @GenieClass

GenieClass is a basic decorator for object-oriented programs. Classes with @GenieClass are automatically processed by **ReactGenie**. Developers can declare basic information about the class by adding a description for prompt generation to the class. For example:

``` typescript filename="DateTime.ts" {3} copy
import {GenieClass, HelperClass} from "reactgenie-lib"

@GenieClass("Representing a date or time")
export class DateTime extends HelperClass{
  	//...
}
```

Classes with the **@GenieClass** can create instances using the **CreateObject()**, and the system will automatically call the **setup()** initialize  the data. For more details, please refer to **ReactGenie Functions**.

Considering the data types of different classes, GenieClass provides two types of classes that can be inherited: **DataClass** and **HelperClass**. <font color='red'>**Please avoid directly inheriting from GenieClass !**</font>



### DataClass

A Dataclass is the basic unit for data management, and an instance of a dataclass can be viewed as a record in a database. The property in a Dataclass can be a number, string, boolean, list, DataClass, or a Helperclass. 

Each dataclass has a unique key for **ReactGenie** to manage. For each instance, information about the instance can be obtained using **GetObject(key)**. Here is an example for DataClass:

```typescript filename="Order.ts" {3} copy
import {GenieClass, DataClass, GenieKey, GenieProperty} from "reactgenie-lib"

@GenieClass("An order")
export class Order extends DataClass {
    @GenieKey
    @GenieProperty()
    public id: string;
    @GenieProperty("The items in the order.")
    public items: OrderItem[] = [];
    @GenieProperty("The date and time the order was placed.")
    public placedTime: DateTime; //DateTime is a HelperClass
  	//...
  
  	//functions...
}
```

Complex data types in Dataclass will be stored using Helperclass, otherwise they cannot be serialized and stored correctly.



### HelperClass

The helperclass is an auxiliary data storage and processing type that depends on the dataclass. Helperclass will not be stored directly in the database, but are serialized and deserialized as they are stored in and retrieved from the dataclass, helping the dataclass manage complex data types. The property in a Dataclass can be a number, string, boolean, list, DataClass, or a Helperclass. 

HelperClass has no key, but can also be instantiated using **CreatObject()**. Here is an example for HelperClass:

```typescript filename="OrderItem.ts" {3} copy
import {GenieClass, HelperClass} from "reactgenie-lib"

@GenieClass("order item")
export class OrderItem extends HelperClass {
    @GenieProperty()
    public foodItem: FoodItem; //Fooditem is a DataClass
    @GenieProperty()
    public quantity: int;
    //...
  
  	//functions...
}
```



## @GenieKey

Geniekey is the identification of ReactGenie for data management, and each DataClass requires a GenieKey. Use @GenieKey to modify the property that is used as the key in the class, which can be used to get the instance after it is created. For example:

```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {3} copy
import {GenieClass, DataClass, GenieKey, GenieProperty} from "reactgenie-lib"

@GenieClass("An Counter")
export class Counter extends DataClass {
    @GenieKey
    @GenieProperty()
    public name: string;
    @GenieProperty()
    public quantity: int;

  	//...
  
  	//functions...
  	constructor({name, quantity}:{name:string, quantity:int}){
			super({});
      this.name = name;
      this.quantity = quantity;
    }
  
  	static setup(){
      Counter.CreateObject({name:"Coin", quantity:5});
    }
}
```

```typescript copy
//Get instance
Counter coin_count = Counter.GetObject({name:"Coin"});
  //coin_count.name: "Coin"
  //coin_count.quantity: 5
```



## @GenieProperty

The GenieProperty modifier is used to modify properties that you want to be accessed and managed by ReactGenie. All members modified with GenieProperty are serialized and stored, and are used for access for multimodal interactions. Developers can also add a description of the property for prompt generation. For example

```typescript filename="Order.ts" {3} copy
//...
@GenieProperty()
public id: string;
@GenieProperty("The items in the order.")
public items: OrderItem[] = [];
@GenieProperty("The date and time the order was placed.")
public placedTime: DateTime; //DateTime is a HelperClass
//...
```



## @GenieFunction

All functions modified by GenieFunction can be called by ReactGenie automatically during multimodal interactions. Developers can add description to the GeniceFunction to state what this function is used for. 

<font color='red'>**Please notice that each GenieFunction should have a return value.**</font>

```typescript filename="Order.ts" {3} copy
@GenieFunction("Get the total price of the active order.")
    getTotalPrice(): float {
        // calculates the total price of the order
      	// ...

      return total;
    }

@GenieFunction("Add one item to the order.")
    addItems({items}: {items: OrderItem[]}): Order {
        // add item to the cart
      	// ...
      
      return this;
    }
```
