# ReactGenie


## Introduction

**ReactGenie** is a programming framework that uses an object-oriented state abstraction approach to seamlessly support building complex multimodal mobile applications. **ReactGenie** enables developers to define both the content and actions in an app and automatically handles the natural language understanding and composition of different modalities by generating a parser that leverages large language models (LLMs).



## **Installation**

**ReactGenie** can be easily installed with NPM.

```bash filename="run in terminal" {3} copy
npm install --save reactgenie-lib
```
